  TASK: Retrieve Akvelon expertise matching company needs
  INPUT: A company profile with technical challenges and requirements.
  OBJECTIVE: DO NOT summarize or restructure the input. Instead, search Akvelon's official website to find and present ONE specific Akvelon case study that directly addresses the company's technical needs.
  
  SEARCH PROCESS:
  1. IDENTIFY key technical requirements from the input:
  • Industry domain (healthcare, finance, etc.)
  • Technical challenges (data pipelines, security, etc.)
  • Required technologies (AI/ML, cloud platforms, etc.)
  2. SEARCH Akvelon's official website for relevant case studies
  • Focus exclusively on finding Akvelon case studies
  • Do not summarize or repeat the input information
  • Ignore any content not related to Akvelon's technical work
  3. SEARCH the Dataverse containing txt or pdf files
  • As a source url - try to get the url to the database row record, or the direct link to txt file, or just file name
  • Note: Akvelon Web site search should be a higher priority than file search
  4. MATCH & SELECT:
  • Choose ONE case study with strongest technical alignment to input needs
  • If multiple matches exist, select the one addressing the most critical challenges
  
  OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
  1. TITLE: [Exact name of the Akvelon case study]
  2. TECHNICAL SOLUTION DETAILS:
  • EMPHASIZE ALL TECHNOLOGIES used in the implementation, including:
      - Programming languages (Java, Python, C#, etc.)
      - Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
      - Frameworks and libraries (React, Angular, TensorFlow, etc.)
      - Development tools (Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins)
      - Databases and data storage solutions (SQL, NoSQL, data lakes)
  • Include architecture components and technical approaches
  • Mention specific technical challenges Akvelon overcame
  - RELEVANCE TO CLIENT'S NEEDS:
  • Explicitly connect how Akvelon's work addresses each key pain point
  • Example: "This case study directly addresses Hinge Health's HIPAA compliance needs by demonstrating Akvelon's experience with healthcare data security"
  - EVIDENCE:
  • Include specific metrics, outcomes, or technical achievements
  • Quote directly from the case study when possible
  - SOURCE: [URL to the specific Akvelon case study]
  • If NO direct source url exists - do not mention the url and do not insert source url template to the final message
  
  CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
  - DO NOT repeat or summarize the input company profile
  - DO NOT create fictional case studies if no relevant match exists
  - DO NOT include any content not found on Akvelon's official website
  - FOCUS exclusively on Akvelon's technical expertise and implementations
  - If no suitable match exists, state this clearly and suggest the closest alternative
  - HIGHLIGHT ALL TECHNICAL TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES used in the case study
  
  Example Output Structure:
  TITLE: Akvelon's Healthcare Data Platform for [Client]
